        <h1 class="ph title">About me</h1>
        <p class="ph"> My goal is to create a high ranking video game company. In order to complete this goal I plan to become one of the greatest software engineers in the world. While becoming one of the best software engineers, I will be running my own businesses on the side. The reason I chose this is because I love video games and want to own a big company.

            Throughout the past 7 months of working in a fast food establishment I have learned to stay calm and assess the situation to make everyone happier and less stressed. I have also learned to manage a team with ease.

            In highschool I received 4 metals from colorguard. I have also participated in ASB in freshman year as a secretary. After working for these past 7 months I have learned that I am better at being the leader. After being in colorguard I learned that I am very flexible in literally and in the work sense. 

            With all my experiences put together I have concluded that I am a calm and flexible leader. I thank you for taking the time to read this it is very much appreciated, If possible I would be even more appreciative if you were to check out the rest of my page.
